                <p>こんにちは!</p>
                <p>My name is Christopher, also known by my online alias "FDD34". I'm a generalist programmer and a game developer. I'm fluent in English and a novice in Japanese. I've been developing games since I was 13-14 years old. My very first programming language was Lua, and since then my knowledge has expanded to C#, HTML, JavaScript, C++, and Python (although I do plan to expand my language capabilities). I'm also a novice artist and animator!</p>
                <p>Although a majority of my work is independent, I do occasionally assist on other people's projects. But usually I play a much smaller role in those circumstances. All my work can be seen in the "Projects" page above.</p>
                <p class="smile"><span>(´･ω･`) ありがとう!</span></p>
